#what this workshop is about

this is literally an introduction to **Processing**.

[**Processing**](http://www.processing.org/) is a programming language.
it's used for writing visual and interactive programs that, for example, draw fancy and colorful shapes on a window, create an full-screen aquarium with fish that avoids your mouse and reacts to your sound, or a piano that makes a weird sound per key you press.

the club **ccc-cgj** likes all this interactive stuff and plans to hold this workshop to:

* get people a _glimpse_ of what can be created with _programming + art_;
* teach people how to use Processing to write _simple, interactive visual patterns_; and
* get people interested in the field of _media arts_ & _interactive design_.

we have day 0 (first) and day 1 (second) in this workshop.

day 0 is more about **introduction**. on day 0, we:

* introduce Processing, media arts and generative arts to audience;
* explain how programming and art can go together;
* show what professional artists are doing with Processing (and other tools);
* let everyone play with some sample Processing programs we wrote;
* teach how to draw shapes with colors, add mouse and keyboard interaction with Processing step-by-step;
* let everyone experiment with their programs.

day 1 is more about **Processing**. on day 1, we:

* explain more programming concepts e.g. variables, conditional statements and loops (and, if possible, arrays and classes) and how they can add variety to our Processing programs;
* let everyone experiment with their programs;
* share Processing resources; and
* share media and resources about media arts & interactive design.

#time and audience.max

this is a weekend-spanning workshop; two days, one workshop event per day, so two workshop events in two days.
either **july 25th and 26th** or **august 1st and 2nd**.

one workshop event takes 2 hours in the afternoon, that is, **14:00 to 16:00**. we can reschedule the time.

#other requirements

##what we need

* a projector and a screen to use slides during the workshop; and
* a power source to power up computers for us as well as the audience (we might bring [extension cords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_strip) on our own.). and
* some space to relax, eat and drink.

##what is best with

* internet (wireless) connection.
* AC

#plans for time beyond

if this workshop is satisfactorily held then we might consider making this regular in the long run (not in the economical sense).
