#try these

##challenge 0

in a program,

* set window size to 600x600.
* clear background to red.
* set fill color to magenta.
* set stroke color to blue.
* draw a 50x60 rectangle with top-left corner at (400, 400).
* draw a circle of radius 60 with center at mouse coordinates.
* draw a line that connects the previous mouse coordinates and the current mouse coordinates.

well, there's only one of these function calls that must be made in `setup()`. you should well know which one it is.

##challenge 1

write a program that keeps drawing lines between the mouse coordinates and the center of the window.

when the mouse is pressed, draw a circle at the mouse coordinates.

when the mouse is released, draw a square at the mouse cooordinates.

##challenge 2

write a painting program with which you can draw rectangles, circles and / or lines by moving / clicking on your mouse.

draw a smiley with your program!
