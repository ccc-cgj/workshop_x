#_README

this should be read on GitHub.

if you cloned the repository / downloaded the whole thing, see `_README.html`.

#thanks

thanks for coming to this workshop where you will learn the basics of Processing, a programming language used to write visual and interactive software.

before you come to the workshop on the very day, **please read this `_README` carefully** so we don't have to sue you or vice versa.

#baysicks (basics)

july 25th and 26th. 14:00 to 16:00 for both days.

[329 Shilong Rd., Shanghai, PRC](http://j.map.baidu.com/VOG14). if you arrive from the east side, climb the thin stairs and enter the third floor. the workshop is held at the room right on the right. well, if you want an escort by someone to the room from the first floor, do call anyone of us.

**bring a laptop and a charger.** remember to get your laptop charged before you come.

#contact

most information is updated on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccc-cgj/workshop_x). if you are a GitHub user, watch it and you'll get constant update with new information.

* cb / greekfellows / orangemurphy / Sigur√∞r has mobile phone number (+86)13764436374 and email address [some.greek.fellows@hotmail.com](mailto:some.greek.fellows@hotmail.com).
* jerry ling has mobile phone number (+86)13818156048.

#if you aren't excited

plug in your mobile phone charger to a power supply and rub the other end on your body. feel the electricity? no, of course not.

#some notice

just note that on the second day we will have much more focus on learning programming, which includes explaining some programming concepts that can be hard to understand for beginners. nevertheless we will base all our learning on Processing, so you should be able to learn visually all these programming concepts.

#necessary downloads

* Processing.
* this repository.

**download Processing before you come to the workshop** [here](https://processing.org/download/?processing).

* _I don't know if I'm running a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows!_ press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>. in the nav bar on the left, right click _My Computer_ and click _Properties..._. Check if your system / processor is 32-bit (`x86`) or 64-bit (`x64`). or, if you don't care, get the 32-bit version.
* _I don't know if I'm running a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux!_ are you really a Linux user? open up a terminal, run `uname -a`. if the output is `x86_64` then you have a 64-bit Linux. otherwise if the output is `i386` or anything in the `i~86` format, you have a 32-bit Linux.

also, **download this repository as a ZIP before you come** [here](https://github.com/ccc-cgj/workshop_x/archive/master.zip).

#contents

as you opened this `_README` you are probably at the directory `_x_00/`. this folder has everything you need for the workshop.

* `_README.md` or `_README.html`: **you are here!**
* `_x_00_eyecatch.md` is where you probably arrived at first. aside from getting attention this is totally useless.
* `_x_00_contents.md` is an incomplete version of the contents to be presented in this workshop. you can look at it but probably it is not of much use.
* `_x_00_overview.md` is really an overview of this workshop event.
* `_all/` contains most of the contents you need during and before the workshop.
  * `_day_0_intro/` contains everything you need before the first day of workshop.
    * `_links.html` has a very short introduction to Processing and a few external links which point to professional artists' portfolios using Processing. **it is recommended that you read through this before the workshop so you come on the day already amazed at what you can do with Processing.**
    * `_sketches/` contains a few sample Processing programs pulled online and those written by us. you can play around with them, but make sure you have Processing already. open the `*.pde` files with Processing.
  * `_day_0_processing/` contains everything you need on the first day of workshop. these are all for helping you with understanding; as we explain things during the workshop, we might ask you to open up a few sketches from this folder.
  * `_day_1_processing/` contains everything you need on the second day of workshop. these are all for helping you with understanding; as we explain things during the workshop, we might ask you to open up a few sketches from this folder.
