#_README

this should be read on GitHub.

if you cloned the repository / downloaded the whole thing, see `_README.html`.

#thanks

thanks for coming to this workshop where you will learn the basics of Processing, a programming language used to write visual and interactive software.

before you come to the workshop on the very day, please read this `_README` carefully so we don't have to sue you or vice versa.

#if you aren't excited

plug in your mobile phone charger to a power supply and rub the other end on your body. feel the electricity? no, of course not.

#necessary downloads

**download Processing before you come to the workshop** [here](https://processing.org/download/?processing).

* _I don't know if I'm running a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows!_ press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>. in the nav bar on the left, right click _My Computer_ and click _Properties..._. Check if your system / processor is 32-bit (`x86`) or 64-bit (`x64`). or, if you don't care, get the 32-bit version.
* _I don't know if I'm running a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux!_ are you really a Linux user? open up a terminal, run `uname -a`. if the output is `x86_64` then you have a 64-bit Linux. otherwise if the output is `i386` or anything in the `i~86` format, you have a 32-bit Linux.

#contents

as you opened this `_README` you are probably at the directory `_x_00/`. this folder has everything you need for the workshop.

* `_README.md` or `_README.html`: **you are here!**
* `_x_00.md` is an incomplete version of the contents to be presented in this workshop. you can look at it but probably it is not of much use.
* `_all/` contains most of the contents you need during and before the workshop.
  * `_day_0_intro/` contains everything you need before the first day of workshop.
    * `_links.html` has a very short introduction to Processing and a few external links which point to professional artists' portfolios using Processing. **it is recommended that you read through this before the workshop so you come on the day already amazed at what you can do with Processing.**
    * `_sketches/` contains a few sample Processing programs pulled online and those written by us. you can play around with them, but make sure you have Processing already. open the `*.pde` files with Processing.
  *ã€€`_day_0_processing/` contains everything you need on the first day of workshop. these are all for helping you with understanding; as we explain things during the workshop, we might ask you to open up a few sketches from this folder.
