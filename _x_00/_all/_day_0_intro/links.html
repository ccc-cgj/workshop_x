	<h1>A Very Brief Introduction to Processing.</h1>
	<p>Processing is the name of a programming language and also an developing environment for programs written in the language. It is used to create programs with visual shapes and forms, often made interactive with a variety of inputs the program can receive: e.g. mouse, keyboard, sound, webcam, local files, motion, hand gestures, speech...</p>
	<p>Although our first workshop is only about visual programs with mouse and keyboard interaction, Processing is much more than that. As we continue our workshops in the future (we probably will), we will introduce to you many more features of this <i>wondersome</i> tool.</p>
	<p>Take a look at what professional coders and artists are doing with Processing.</p>
